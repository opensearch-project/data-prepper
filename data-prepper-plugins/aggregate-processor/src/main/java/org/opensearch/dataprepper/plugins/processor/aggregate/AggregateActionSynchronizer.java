/**
 * An {@link AggregateAction} contains two functons, {@link AggregateAction#concludeGroup(AggregateActionInput)} and {@link AggregateAction#handleEvent(Event, AggregateActionInput)},
 * that potentially modify a shared state that needs to be synchronized between multiple worker threads. These two functions should not be called on the same {@link AggregateGroup} at the same time,
 * and this class enforces that behavior using the two {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock} that belong to each {@link AggregateGroup}.
 * The synchronization is designed to hold the following conditions:
 *
 * <ol>
 *     <li>The critical sections of concludeGroup and handleEventForGroup should not be entered at the same time</li>
 *     <li>If a thread is trying to enter the critical section for concludeGroup, no new threads should be able to attempt to enter the critical section for handleEventForGroup.
 *         This condition is achieved using a turnstile synchronization pattern that locks and then immediately unlocks the concludeGroupLock</li>
 *     <li>If multiple threads try to conclude the same {@link AggregateGroup} at the same time, only one should gain access to the critical section for concludeGroup, and
 *     the remaining threads should immediately return from concludeGroup</li>
 * </ol>
