# Generate Release Notes

To help generate release notes, you can use the following script.
It will produce a formatted file, but you need to organize the content and possibly reword or remove.

You need two tools installed:

* [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)
* Python 3

Run:

```
./generate-release-notes.sh v2.7
```

This will produce a file named `data-prepper.release-notes-version.md`.
You can now use this to help you create the release notes.
These release notes still need some work, but they are nicely formatted to help you get started.
